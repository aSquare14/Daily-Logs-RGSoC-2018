Today we tried fixing one bug of the Admin model but we ended up messing up a whole lot of code. We read about how adding two Devise Models can cause problems, how to resolve them, how to write files called "concerns", etc.
We worked on writing tests for Action Mailer.
We also had a discussion with our coach Athitya who gave us valuable insights into the problems we are currently facing. Not a very productive day but we read a lot of theory !
