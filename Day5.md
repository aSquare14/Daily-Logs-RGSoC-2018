#### **Tasks completed today**
  - Wrote tests for checkbox.
  - We tried writing tests for radiobuttons but struggled with it. Hope to complete it on Monday.
  - We worked on PR #910 and #911.
  - In between Prateksha had problems with [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook), which is the UI development environment. We then realized that the last commit that was merged mistakenly deleted important functions. We created an [issue](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme/issues/912) to fix this and sent a [PR](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme/pull/913).
  - Videocall with supervisor, mentors, coaches.
  - Worked on Introduction blog post.
