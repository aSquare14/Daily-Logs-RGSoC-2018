#### **Tasks completed today**
  - Continued working on the PR.
  - Today, we understood the true meaning of "test driven devlopement". As soon as we started writing tests, we realized our variable
    names were conflicting, we lacked a few associations and validations. Refactored code.
  - Sorted our db.
  - Finally wrote tests for Report Model ! :D
  - Meeting with Srishti.

#### **Things we learnt**
  - TEST DRIVEN DEVLOPEMENT is love.

#### **To-Do**
  - Write RSpec tests for mailer and Admin.
  - Improve UI of admin panel and add DELETE option.
